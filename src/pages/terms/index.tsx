          Website reserves the right to terminate your account and keep your
          membership fee as a fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are liable for Fees for Membership together with all applicable
          taxes. Users may cancel their Membership at any time by contacting
          This Website&apos;s customer service or logging into their account
          details via the descriptor website indicated on their email receipt.
          Users must cancel their Membership 48 hours prior to the rebill date
          if they do not wish their Membership to renew with associated Fees. Up
          until the date a Membership is canceled the User authorizes his
          Website to continue charging the User&apos;s Payment Method to pay:
          (i) Fees for Membership; (ii) all purchases of other products,
          services and entertainment provided by Portal; and (iii) other
          liabilities of yours to This Website or any third party.

          Delayed Transactions. In the event a User&apos;s Payment Method was
          declined This Website may attempt to process the transaction again
          under the same conditions as the transaction was initiated by the
          User, within a few days of the User&apos;s first attempt to purchase
          their Membership. Where the Payment Method is approved in such a
          circumstance, the User will receive an email confirming the successful
          completion of their transaction.

          Memberships may be canceled on the user&apos;s dashboard or by
          contacting Portal customer service. If a Membership is canceled before
          the renewal date the User will still have access for the remainder of
          the period already paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          We generally offer very limited refunds to new users. The reason is
          that you can &ldquo;inspect the product&ldquo; (that is the
          membership) by accessing all our sites in read-only mode before
          becoming a paid member. Thus, except being able to participate on our
          sites, nothing changes. You were/are able to inspect what you buy
          before buying and therefore we don&apos;t give refunds. You knew what
          you were buying. If you doubt becoming a member, we suggest you
          don&apos;t.
