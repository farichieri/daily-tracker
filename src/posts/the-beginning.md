The key to becoming the master of your time is tracking your daily tasks and habits. When you write what you have to do in advance, you get a better view of what you can and can not do in the day.

# Benefits of tracking activities

- You'll gain control of your time
- You'll be more realistic and organized
- You'll make better estimates,
- You'll be more accountable and productive,
- You'll learn how to single-task instead of multitasking.

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
